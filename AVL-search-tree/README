Project organization
On the lab assignment page it said "Do not change the names of the files.". I was worried that if I created a new file to better organize 
this project it would interfere with your testing module. If I was wrong to assume so please don't dock me too many marks. Reorganizing this
project would only take 5 minutes and I am 100% capable of doing this simple task. Please email me if you wish to discuss this more in depth.
